          Harry James Potter is a fictional character and the titular
          protagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The
          majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the
          orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard.
          Thus, he attends Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to
          practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus
          Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron
          Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already
          famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is
          tied with that of Lord Voldemort â€“ the internationally feared Dark
          Wizard and murderer of his parents, Lily and James. The book and film
          series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world
          and defeat Voldemort.

          Hermione Jean Granger is a fictional character in J. K. Rowling's
          Harry Potter series. She first appears in Harry Potter and the
          Philosopher's Stone, as a new student on her way to Hogwarts. After
          Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom,
          she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft
          recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations.
          Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl,
          with her insecurity and fear of failure.
